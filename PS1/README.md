# TDT4200 Problem set 1: Intro to MPI

## Finite difference approximation of the 1D shallow water equations using MPI
In this assignment you will take a serial implementation of the Finite Difference Method (FDM) for solving the 1D shallow water equations and write a distributed version using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The serial implementation is provided and is similar to the code you worked on in the previous assignment (optional PS0). Information on solving the shallow water equations using FDM and on parallelization with MPI is described in the lecture slides.

The serial solution can be found in `shallow_water_serial.c` and should be kept as a reference. A copy of the serial solution can be found in `shallow_water_parallel.c`, in which you should write your parallel implementation.

## Run
### Setup
`make setup`

Creates folders `data`, `plots` and `video`.
- `data`: contains output from the simulation
- `plots`: contains output from plotting
- `video`: contains output from video generation

Compiles the code for comparing solutions.

### Serial solution
**Compile**

`make serial`

**Run**

`./serial -n [grid_size] -i [max_iteration] -s [snapshot_frequency]`

**Example**  

```
make serial
./serial -n 1024 -i 100000 -s 1000
```

**Compile and run**

You can also execute both of the above commands together with default values with `make run_serial`

### Parallel solution
**Compile**

`make parallel`

**Run**

`mpirun -np [number of MPI processes] [--oversubscribe] ./parallel -n [grid_size] -i [max_iteration] -s [snapshot_frequency]`

**!** MPI will complain that there are "not enough slots available" if you try to run with more processes than there are available processors. Passing the `--oversubscribe` option to `mpirun` will circumvent this.

**Example**  

```
make parallel
mpirun -np 4 ./parallel -n 1024 -i 100000 -s 1000
```

**Compile and Run**

You can also execute both of the above commands together with default values with `make run`.

## Visualize
### Plots
`./plot_solution.sh -n [grid_size]`

Plots the program output using [gnuplot](http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net).

Alternatively, you can compile, run, and plot the solution with default values with `make plot` .

You can plot the serial solution with `make plot_serial`.

**Example**

`./plot_solution.sh -n 1024`

### Video
`make show`

Compiles, runs, and plots the parallel solution with default values and creates a video using [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org).

You can create a video from the serial solution with `make show_serial`.

## Check
`make check`

Compiles and runs the parallel solution with default values and compares the output data to reference data.

You can check the serial solution with `make check_serial`.

## Options
Option | Description | Restrictions | DefaultÂ value
:------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ 
**-n** | Number of grid points in one spatial dimension | > 0 | 1024
**-i** | Number of iterations | > 0 | 100000
**-s** | Number of iterations between each time the grid state is saved to file | > 0 | 1000
**-np**| Number of processes (MPI option) | > 0 | 4
